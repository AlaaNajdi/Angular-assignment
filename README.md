# Jobs Dashboard - Angular Assignment

This is a simple, responsive jobs dashboard built with Angular. This project marks my first hands-on experience with Angular.Throughout the development process, I encountered a few technical challenges. However, I remained committed to learning by referring to official documentation, exploring Angular Material resources, and watching educational tutorials.
This assignment provided a valuable opportunity to expand my skill set and gain practical understanding of a new front-end framework.
